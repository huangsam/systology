# Systology

Systology is my documentation collection for studying systems: discoveries, patterns, and practical learnings. It serves as a knowledge base for system design, implementation, and experimentation, drawing from real-world projects and trials.

- Principles: Core ideas and heuristics for system behavior.
- Designs: System design explorations with trade-offs and decisions.
- Deep Dives: Long-form investigations into projects and findings.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, please make sure you have [Hugo] and [Python] installed, then run:

```shell
# Start the Hugo development server with drafts enabled
make serve
```

Then you can access the site at `https://localhost:1313/`.

Happy learning! 🙏
