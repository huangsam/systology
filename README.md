# Systology

Systology is my collection of docs for studying systems at scale. It serves as a knowledge base for my synthesized learnings, drawing from work experience and the world wide web.

- Principles: Core ideas and heuristics for system behavior.
- Designs: System explorations with trade-offs and decisions.
- Deep Dives: Findings from my public projects on GitHub.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, please make sure you have [Hugo] installed, then run:

```shell
# Start the Hugo development server with drafts enabled
make serve
```

Then you can access the site at `https://localhost:1313/`.

Happy learning! 🙏
