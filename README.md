# Systology

Systology is my documentation collection for studying systems: discoveries, patterns, and practical learnings. It serves as a knowledge base for system design, implementation, and experimentation, drawing from real-world projects and trials.

- Principles: Guiding rules, heuristics, and core ideas for system behavior and reasoning.
- Designs: Explorations of system design problems, with sketches, trade-offs, and decision records.
- Deep Dives: Long-form investigations into specific projects, including methodology, data, findings, and next steps.
