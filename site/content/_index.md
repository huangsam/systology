# Systology

Systology is my documentation collection for studying systems: discoveries, patterns, and practical learnings. It serves as a knowledge base for system design, implementation, and experimentation, drawing from real-world projects and trials.

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go have fun!")
}
```
