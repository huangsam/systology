# Systology

Systology is my documentation collection for studying systems: discoveries, patterns, and practical learnings. It serves as a knowledge base for system design, implementation, and experimentation, drawing from real-world projects and trials.

- `principles/`: Guiding rules, heuristics, and core ideas for system behavior and reasoning.
- `designs/`: Explorations of system design problems, with sketches, trade-offs, and decision records.
- `deep-dives/`: Long-form investigations into specific projects, including methodology, data, findings, and next steps.

## Conventions

- Filenames: Use kebab-case for markdown files.
- Structure: Follow templates for consistency.
- Updates: Add new notes in the appropriate directory.

## Getting Started

- Review `principles/` for foundational guidance.
- Explore `designs/` for problem-solving frameworks.
- Dive into `deep-dives/` for detailed project analyses.
- Add a new note using kebab-case filenames and relevant templates.
